# 🔍 FULL SYSTEM AUDIT REPORT — 2026-02-18
**Auditor:** @Vigil (The Eye) + @Marcus (The Maestro)  
**Scope:** Construct FM Sprint 2 debrief + Agent skill injection + Ecosystem health check  
**Previous Audit:** 2026-02-11 (Brain sync, 47 agents registered, 60 learnings synced)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit documents the **Construct FM Sprint 2** session (2026-02-18) and injects all learnings into the agent ecosystem. The sprint delivered a fully functional static Next.js site deployed to Hostinger, with a critical deploy pipeline bug discovered and fixed. All learnings have been propagated to @Owen, @Sebastian, and @Vigil SKILL.md files.

### Overall Health Score: **9.5/10** (unchanged — no regressions detected)

## Sprint 2 — Construct FM Delivery Summary

### What Was Built
| Component | Status | Notes |
|:----------|:-------|:------|
| 7 case study pages | ✅ Live | All slugs defined in `lib/case-studies.ts` |
| Prices removed from case studies | ✅ Verified | Removed from source + deploy confirmed |
| AccreditationBadges component | ✅ New | ISO, CHAS, SafeContractor badges |
| Real logo + hero background | ✅ Live | `constructfm-logo-nobackground.png` |
| Updated Header navigation | ✅ Live | — |
| Deploy script fixed (`deploy_next.py`) | ✅ Fixed | Now uploads from local `out/` only |
| Git pushed to `construct.fm` repo | ✅ Done | Commit `c1fe0c9` on main |

### Critical Bug Found & Fixed
**Bug:** `deploy_next.py` was reading HTML from the live Hostinger server and re-uploading it. This created a stale content loop — removed pricing data kept reappearing on the live site even after being deleted from source code.

**Fix:** Rewrote deploy script to ALWAYS build locally (`next build`) and upload from the local `out/` directory. Server is write-only — never read from it.

## Agent Skill Updates (2026-02-18)

### @Owen — 5 new learnings added
| # | Learning | Key Rule |
|:--|:---------|:---------|
| LL-001 | Hostinger static deploy pattern | Always upload from local `out/` — never read from server |
| LL-002 | Slug directory structure | Use `trailingSlash: true` → `[slug]/index.html` not `[slug].html` |
| LL-003 | Post-deploy verification | Verify *removals* with curl, not just additions |
| LL-004 | Windows PowerShell scripts | Avoid Unicode in print statements; use ASCII |
| LL-005 | Git repo isolation | Client repos must be siblings of AgOS, never children |

### @Sebastian — 5 new learnings added
| # | Learning | Key Rule |
|:--|:---------|:---------|
| LL-001 | Next.js static export config | `output: 'export'` + `trailingSlash: true` + `images: { unoptimized: true }` |
| LL-002 | API routes in static export | Don't work — use Vercel for projects needing both static + API |
| LL-003 | Single source of truth for slugs | Define in `lib/case-studies.ts`, mirror in deploy script |
| LL-004 | Sensitive data in static builds | Remove from source entirely — don't just hide from UI |
| LL-005 | Chatbot KB architecture | `kb.ts` → `system-prompt.ts` → `route.ts` → `ChatWidget.tsx` |

### @Vigil — 4 new learnings added
| # | Learning | Key Rule |
|:--|:---------|:---------|
| LL-001 | Stale HTML cache bug pattern | If removed content still appears live → deploy pipeline is the bug |
| LL-002 | Price leak pattern | Check ALL importers of pricing files, not just obvious components |
| LL-003 | Deploy verification checklist (removals) | 4-step check: curl + hard refresh + incognito + page source |
| LL-004 | Git repo contamination check | Run `git status --short` before every AgOS commit |

## Ecosystem Health Check

### Agent Roster
| Metric | Value | Status |
|:-------|:------|:-------|
| SKILL.md files on disk | 42 folders in `.agent/skills/` | ✅ |
| Agents with Learning Logs | 3 updated today (Owen, Sebastian, Vigil) | ✅ |
| Agents needing Learning Log updates | ~39 remaining (no new learnings for them today) | ⚠️ Ongoing |

### New Agents Spotted (not in original roster)
The following SKILL.md files exist on disk but are NOT in the AGENTS.md roster — they were added after the last audit:
- `scholar/` — @Scholar (Dr. Elias Thorne, "The Professor") — Deep Research
- `hugo/` — @Hugo (Hugo Reeves, "The Crawler") — GitHub Intelligence & OSINT
- `vivienne/` — @Vivienne (Vivienne Frost, "The Visionary") — Brand Identity

**Action:** These agents ARE listed in AGENTS.md already — the SKILL.md files were created after the Training Day. No action needed.

### Git Repo Status
| Repo | Last Commit | Status |
|:-----|:------------|:-------|
| `Antigravity_Orchestra` (AgOS brain) | `b795731` (Feb 2026) | ✅ Clean — no incorrect pushes |
| `construct.fm` | `c1fe0c9` (2026-02-18) | ✅ Sprint 2 pushed |
| `JonnyAI_JaiOS_5.0` | Pending this commit | ⏳ Needs push |

### MCP Tooling
| Server | Status |
|:-------|:-------|
| GitHub MCP | ✅ Active — used for repo verification today |
| Brave Search | ✅ Active |
| Memory | ✅ Active |
| Desktop Commander | ✅ Active |
| Figma | ✅ Active |
| Playwright | ✅ Active |
| Context7 | ✅ Active |
| Supabase | ✅ Active |

## Key Directives Reinforced Today

1. **No Path Guessing** — The `.agent/` folder was NOT in `AgOS 3.0 template/` — it was in `JonnyAI_JaiOS_5.0/`. Always check both workspace locations before assuming a file doesn't exist.

2. **Self-Annealing** — The stale deploy bug was fixed at the script level (`deploy_next.py`), not just patched in the output. The fix is permanent.

3. **Truth-Lock** — Pricing data was removed from source AND verified gone from the live site before the sprint was closed.

4. **Repo Isolation** — Confirmed that no Construct FM files were accidentally pushed to the AgOS shared brain repo.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Run `brain_sync.py`** to push today's 14 new learnings (Owen x5, Sebastian x5, Vigil x4) to the Supabase Shared Brain.
2. **Add `deploy_next.py` pattern** to the `methodology/` folder as a reusable deployment SOP for all future Hostinger static projects.
3. **Consider Vercel** for construct.fm when the AI chatbot is activated — Hostinger static can't serve API routes.
4. **Update `directives/repo_mapping.md`** to document that `JonnyAI_JaiOS_5.0/` is the canonical location for `.agent/` skills, not `AgOS 3.0 template/`.

## Sign-Off

> "The pipeline was the bug, not the code. We found it, fixed it permanently, and taught the orchestra so it never happens again. That's the Antigravity way."
